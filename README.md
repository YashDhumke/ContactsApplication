ContactsApplication is a comprehensive full-stack application designed to offer an efficient solution for managing and organizing both personal and professional contacts. The project brings together a blend of modern technologies to create a robust, user-friendly contact management system.

# Overview
The application is crafted to handle a variety of contact management tasks seamlessly. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and view contacts in a streamlined manner, with a focus on ease of use and performance. Whether you're managing a small set of personal contacts or a larger database of professional connections, ContactsApplication provides a reliable platform for keeping track of your important relationships.

# Frontend
1) React.js is employed to build the frontend of the application, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience. React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enables the creation of interactive components that update efficiently with user interactions. This library is chosen for its performance benefits and ease of integration with other technologies.

2) Redux Toolkit is utilized for state management, allowing the application to handle complex state logic and interactions with ease. Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of managing state across the application, making it more predictable and easier to debug. This choice supports a clean architecture and efficient data flow, enhancing the overall user experience.

3) HTML and CSS are used to structure and style the application’s interface. HTML provides the foundation for the content and layout, while CSS ensures that the application is visually appealing and aligned with modern design principles. Together, these technologies create a polished and professional look, contributing to a pleasant user interface.

# Backend
1) .NET Web API On the backend, .NET Web API is employed to manage data processing and business logic. .NET Web API is a powerful framework for building HTTP services, and it provides a flexible and scalable solution for handling API requests. This technology supports the development of robust server-side logic and ensures that the application can handle various types of data operations securely and efficiently.

2) SQLite is chosen as the database solution for storing contact information. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database engine that provides a compact and efficient way to manage data. Its simplicity and ease of integration make it an ideal choice for applications where a full-scale database server is not necessary. SQLite’s performance and reliability contribute to a seamless data management experience within the application.
